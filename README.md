# HexapodCalculator
C# Linux program to calculate the leg lengths of a Stewart Platform (hexapod) given the platform angle and position relative to the base. Why wasn't this written in Python? Because I used this to learn C#.

To run the binary:

1. Download /bin/Debug/net5.0/HexapodCalculator to directory of your choice
2. Install dependency: $sudo apt install dotnet-runtime-5.0
3. Make HexapodCalculator executable if it isn't already: $sudo chmod +x ./HexapodCalculator
4. Run it: $./HexapodCalculator
